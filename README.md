#CoderClicker

By [Edward Jiang](http://twitter.com/EdwardStarcraft)

CoderClicker is a game inspired by Cookie Clicker. It's a multiplayer clicking game built with Meteor.js to use as a workshop for [CodeDay](http://codeday.org/)!

I'll have a link to a tutorial on how to build this from scratch soon!
